"""8. Advanced Challenges:
1.Create a list of numbers from 1 to 20. Write a Python program to generate two separate lists:
One containing only the even numbers.
Another containing only the odd numbers.
2.Write a Python program that reads a list of integers and returns 
a new list containing only the unique elements (i.e., removing duplicates).
Given a list of tuples representing (name, age), sort the list by age in ascending order."""

        even_numbers.append(num)
    else:

"""5. Mathematical Operations:
1.Create two lists of numbers, and use the + operator to concatenate them. 
Then, use the * operator to repeat the elements of one list 3 times.
2.Given a list of numbers, write a Python program to create a new list
 where each element is doubled (i.e., each element is multiplied by 2).

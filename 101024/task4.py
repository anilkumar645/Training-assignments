"""4. Aliasing and Cloning:
1.Create a list of numbers. Assign the list to another variable and modify the original list. 
Check if the second list also changes. Then, create a copy of the original list and show that 
modifying the copy does not affect the original list.
2.Write a Python program to demonstrate how changes in a list's alias affect both lists,
 while changes in a cloned list do not.
